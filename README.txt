Marques D. B. A time series signal generator with specified frequencies, amplitudes, phase differences, sampling rate, duration, signal-to-noise ratio, and time delay in MATLAB. 2018.

Useful to test the effect of a variety of parameters in a diversity of spectral estimates.

Includes code of examples to simulate sine waves, delayed signals, time-variant signals, phase-amplitude coupled signals, pink noise, and temporal interference.
